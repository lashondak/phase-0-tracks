<!- The purpose of semantic tags is to provide data and meaningful information to and about the page. It can also help in searching and accesibility. I really believe they all have their own purpose and that no one tag is more important, however, I think the 'main' tag is great because it helps people with disabilities access content. -The browser adds the content based on the tags and the order in which they are writtten. It goes from top to bottom, left to right.-I learned about snippets and how useful they are. I also learned more about indents and conventions. I am sure that when I have time I'll set up some snippets. -I really dislike making tables with colspan and rowspan. I'll have to practice some more. In general, I don't like making tables at all.
