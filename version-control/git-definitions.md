# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - Version control is a tool to track progress, review and revert changes, and create backups of code. It is useful because it allows you to protect your master files of code while updating different versions of it. 
    - 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - A branch is a directory that contains a copy of a master file. You would use a branch to create changes or updates to a program without adversely affecting the master copy. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - A commit is when you have created updates to a feature/branch and uploaded it to your repository. A good commit message is short, descriptive and follows proper convention. 
    
* What is a merge conflict?
    - A merge conflict is when there is a conflict between branches or updates being synced. This can occur if a person does not have the most updated version of the master when updating (they haven't pulled the latest copy). If multiple branches are trying to be updated into master, but their changes conflict each other, the merge cannot be completed.
